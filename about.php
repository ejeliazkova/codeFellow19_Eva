    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>Hi :) My name is Eva and I'm a St. Louis native. I'm double majoring in Cognitive Neuroscience
        and Spanish at WashU. I've always been curious about language and language aquisition which is
        most likely inspired by my bilingual upbringing. While I spoke English at school, I mainly spoke
        Bulgarian at home. 
    </p>
    <p>As a kid, I sometimes struggled to switch back and forth between the two languages: often
        forgetting a word or hesitating to speak. It was pretty frustrating and confusing, but overall
        empowering. I could communicate with an entirely different demographic in way that picked up on the
        nuances of the culture. This duality is increasingly commonplace in today's globally connected
        world so I think a lot of people can relate.
    </p>
    <p>My personal experience and the understanding that this is not unique occurrence sparked an interest in
        the neurological basis and mental processes behind language learning and usage. How do you learn and 
        remember all of the words and rules of a new language? And how does the answer to that question factor
        into our increasingly interconnected world? And finally, how can we create and improve our technology
        to aid in language aquisition, communication, and understanding across a global network?
